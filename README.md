- **AI Modes:** Choose between `Human (Soft Relief)` for organic shapes or `Standard (Hard Edge)` for geometric objects.

### ⚡ Action & Animation Engine
- **Pre-set Actions:** Instantly apply animations like Idle, Walk, Run, Fight, Shake, and Vibe.
- **Mood System:** Change the model's "emotion" (😊, 😡, 😢, 😎).
- **Playback Control:** Play/Pause animations, adjust playback speed, and toggle cinematic camera modes.

  - `Void` (Minimalist)

### 🛠️ Editing & Modifiers
- **Geometry Modifiers:** Apply real-time deformations like `Twist`, `Taper`, `Flip`, and `Clone`.
- **Material Tweaks:** Adjust Height Depth, Base Color, Roughness, and Metalness sliders to change the look of the model.
- **Scene Graph:** View and manage objects within the scene.

### 💾 Project Memory & Export
- **Save/Load:** Save your current state to JSON and load it back later.
- **Multi-Format Export:**
  - 💾 **GLB / OBJ / STL:** Download your modified 3D models.
  - 📸 **IMG:** Capture screenshots.
  - 🔴 **4K Video:** Record high-quality video of your animations.
